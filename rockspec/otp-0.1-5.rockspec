    This is a simple OATH-HOTP and OATH-TOTP implementation in pure lua
    that makes use of luaossl for its hashing needs. It can be used as
    a generation and verification library and is compatible with the
    RFCs 4226 and 6238. It only supports the SHA-1 hashing algorithm
    (as specified in the RFCs).
